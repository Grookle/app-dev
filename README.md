# Arcane Season 2 Review: (Spoilers)
Arcane Season 2
_________________________________________
<Pretty much what I said last week. Third act didn't deliver, it's just sad that everything we saw in season 1 were diminished by this season. i.e Jinx's resolve. 
Season 2 went just like a Pixar ending. Too much fan service and lacks substance. It's messy and all over the place and have no solid ground. Like the previous season, it did not went like it's a big finale, it's a fucking tea party. Then they sidelined the Zaun vs. Piltover storyline like bruh what? And first of all, I do like Jinx x Ekko stuff but why we have a whole episode dedicated for that. Then Jinx and Vi are suddenly okay (along with Caitlyn), idk man. Too many stuff happening at the same time, it failed to explain everything. They butchered Viktor's in game character and design. (I KNOW HE'S GETTING A REWORK).
PLEASE NEVER BE CANON INGAME.
